Given a set of letters, print out all the ways those letters can be
combined into a set of words which use up all the letters.

Given a word dictionary, sort the letters in each word, and add an entry
to a disk-based multi-map that maps the sorted letters to the word.

Given the set of letters, generate the partition of the set: the
division of that set into sets of non-overlapping, non-empty subsets
that together contain all elements from the set. For each of these sets,
sort the letters in each subset, then look up the words that map to
them. If all subsets map to one or more words, then print them out.
